		I, according to my copy, have done set it in

		and learn the noble acts of chivalry, and the
		gentle and virtuous deeds that some knights
		used in those days.

1. Introduction


	What is the difference between an MTS4, a Staff Engineer and
	a Senior Staff Engineer.  What skills and responsibilities measure 
	progress along the Senior Technical Staff career ladder?  The 
	Engineering leveling tool provides general guidelines to answering 
	these questions, and defines the minimum requirements for the jobs.

	The setting of minimum requirements is, however, a formula
	for failure.  If we are to succeed, as individuals or a 
	company, we need to set our sights higher than the "minimum 
	requirements".  In order to achieve excellence, people need
	to take a more expansive view of their responsibilities.  We need 
	to define and promulgate guidelines for what defines exemplary 
	senior technical performance.

	Moreover, the Engineering Leveling tool is designed to
	clarify the differences between the levels.  It is not
	intended as a definition of the jobs or as a tutorial on
	how we should go about our jobs.  If people are to be 
	successful at a job, they need to know exactly what is 
	expected of them.
